Action Suggester API
This project is a simple Django-based API that uses an external AI (LLM, such as Gemini API) to analyze the tone and intent of a user's message and suggests relevant actions. The results, including the query, tone, intent, and suggested actions, are logged to a PostgreSQL database.

üöÄ Features
POST /api/analyze/: Accepts a user message and returns an analysis of the tone and intent along with suggested actions.

LLM Integration: Uses Gemini (or another LLM) API to identify tone and intent.

Database Logging: Logs each request's details to a PostgreSQL database.

Action Suggestions: Based on the tone and intent, the API suggests up to 3 predefined actions.

 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name/action-suggester-api.git
cd action-suggester-api
2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure PostgreSQL Database
Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and a database created. Update your settings.py in the project with the database credentials:


# settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
5. Configure LLM API Key
To connect to the Gemini API (or any other LLM), you must pass the API key directly into the code:


# action_logic.py

import google.generativeai as genai

API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
genai.configure(api_key=API_KEY)

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
Alternatively, you can configure your API_KEY in any preferred way (like dotenv, but this is an optional change).

6. Run Migrations
Create the necessary database tables:


python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
7. Start the Django Development Server

python manage.py runserver
Now your API is accessible at http://localhost:8000/.

üì° API Endpoint
POST /api/analyze/
Request:

{
  "query": "Your message here"
}
Example:

{
  "query": "I want to order pizza tonight!"
}
Response:

{
  "id": 1,
  "query": "I want to order pizza tonight!",
  "tone": "Happy",
  "intent": "Order Food",
  "suggested_actions": [
    {
      "action_code": "ORDER_FOOD",
      "display_text": "Order Food Online"
    },
    {
      "action_code": "SHARE_NEWS",
      "display_text": "Share Latest News"
    }
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-04-18T10:43:33.123Z"
}
Error Response (if no query is provided):

{
  "error": "Query field is required"
}
üß™ Testing with Postman
Open Postman.

Set the method to POST.

Set the URL to http://localhost:8000/api/analyze/.

In the Body tab, choose raw and select JSON format.

Enter a query in the JSON format, like:


{
  "query": "I want to order pizza tonight!"
}
Send the request and check the response in the body section.

üìö Code Structure
action_logic.py: Contains functions for analyzing the message, identifying tone and intent, and suggesting actions.

models.py: Defines the database model for logging queries and actions.

serializers.py: Contains the serializer for the QueryLog model, ensuring the correct output structure.

views.py: Defines the APIView that handles the /api/analyze/ endpoint.

urls.py: Routes the /api/analyze/ request to the correct view.

settings.py: Django project configuration, including database and installed apps.

üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
The following Python packages are required:

Django: Web framework.

Django REST Framework (DRF): For creating REST APIs.

google-generativeai: For interacting with the Gemini API.

psycopg2: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.

python-dotenv (optional, for API key management via .env).

üöÄ Troubleshooting
Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running and correctly configured in settings.py.

If you're having issues with the Gemini API, check if your API key is valid and the rate limits are not exceeded.
